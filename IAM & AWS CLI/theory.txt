IAM: 

- IAM = identity and Access Management, Global Service


* Users & Groups
    Users: people within your organization, and can be grouped
    Groups: only contain users, not other groups
Users don't have to belong a group, and user can belong to multiple groups

 why use IAM -> PERMISSIONS of the users (JSON documents called POLICIES)


 Create adm account (root account) -> depois criar outro usuário. deixar a conta root apenas como segurança
