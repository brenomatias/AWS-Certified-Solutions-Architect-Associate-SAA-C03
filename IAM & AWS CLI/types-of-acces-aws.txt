To access AWS, you have three options:
 - WAS Management Console 
 - AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) -> terminal: protected by access keys
 - AWS Software Developer Kit (SDK) - for code: protected by access keys

-> Access Keys are generated through the AWS Console
   (users manage their own access keys)
      - Access Key ID ~= username
      - Secret Access Key ~= password
